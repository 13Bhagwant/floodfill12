# We have two main goals in Module 2: Fixing bugs and refactoring the Flood Fill code; and producing a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Flood Fill as a reference:
## Bug fix and refactor module 2 code: The Flood Fill game template provided in module 2 includes some improvements over the module 1 template, but it also contains some bugs and some poorly structured JavaScript. For this task you must:
1. Install ESList (requires installing npm) and use it to clean up the poorly structured JavaScript (i.e. linting errors identified by ESLint – not bugs)
2. Identify and fix two three bugs that I have intentionally left in the module 2 code. I suggest using console and debugging tools as described in our readings this week.
Improve the module 2 code by reducing the number of calls to the render()function.
## Develop a Tic Tac Toe game: The fundamental structures of Flood Fill would work equally well for a game of Tic Tac Toe, with the major difference that there is no requirement for a flood fill (or similar) algorithm in Tic Tac Toe. For this task you must create a 2-player (meaning assume both players are sitting together and playing using the same computer and mouse – no need for ‘AI’ or remote play options) Tic Tac Toe game that includes the following:
1. Use the module 2 code as a base – keep as much as you can that would be reasonable for a Tic Tac Toe game (i.e. history, undo, render and updateGridAt – with necessary changes)
2. Make sure to install ESLint to keep your code clean (note that all project submissions going forward will *require* the inclusion of ESLint).
3. Use canvas to draw your game (note you don’t necessarily *need* Xs and Os – you can just fill in cells with two colours, if that’s easier)
